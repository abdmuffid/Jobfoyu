**Program Background**
The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia's large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program's core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia's previous 19 years of support to Indonesia's decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:* Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub\\-national service delivery.
* Pillar 2: Better sub\\-national governance for service delivery.
* Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.

  

SKALA is implemented at the national level with an office in Jakarta and at the subnational level with offices in Aceh, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku, Gorontalo, Kalimantan Utara, Tanah Papua. In addition to the 3 pillars, SKALA works across 4 general themes of Public Financial Management, Minimum Service Standards, Data and Analysis and GEDSI. **About DT Global Asia Pacific**

We’re looking for an experienced and proactive DevSecOps engineer to architect and own secure delivery across our Development Process. In this critical, hands\\-on role, you will be the champion for shifting security to the earliest stage of development. Your mission is to empower our engineering teams to deliver secure and high\\-quality code at speed by embedding security guardrails and tooling directly into their workflows.
### **What You Will Do**

* + **Embed Security into the SDLC:** You will integrate and automate a suite of security tooling \\- including secrets management, Software Composition Analysis (SCA), Static Application Security Testing (SAST), and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning into our CI/CD pipelines.
	+ **Secure the Developer Workflow:** A key focus will be securing our development platforms (GitHub/GitLab) from the ground up, implementing security best practices for repository settings, branch protections, and code access.
	+ **Architect Security as Code:** You will leverage your deep programming skills in Python, Go, JavaScript, etc., to build custom tooling, automation, integrations, and supporting documentation that help create a frictionless security experience for accelerated development.
	+ **Act as a Security SME:** With your keen ability to spot security flaws quickly, you will serve as a subject matter expert for engineering teams, guiding them on secure coding and pragmatic remediation strategies.
	+ **Incorporating AI to enhance security:** You will be a key contributor to our efforts on improving our security posture by researching and applying AI\\-driven solutions to enhance threat detection, automate vulnerability management, and intelligently secure our development lifecycle.

### **What You Will Need**

* + 5\\+ years of proven experience in a hands\\-on DevSecOps or Application Security role with a strong DevOps foundation.
	+ Solid Kubernetes experience (deployments, RBAC, basic networking, troubleshooting).
	+ Development skills at minimum: Python, Go, and JavaScript code.
	+ Practical \\& deep understanding of the use of SCA, SAST, secrets, and IaC scanning tools
	+ Strong Git skills (branching, rebasing, signed commits, access controls).
	+ Experience securing GitHub or GitLab (tokens, branch protections, CI secrets).
	+ Excellent written and verbal communication skills tailored for diverse audiences.

**About the Team**  

Our DevSecOps team works at the intersection of security, platform reliability, and developer velocity. We focus on solving real platform and security challenges, not just running tools. When something doesn’t exist, we build or script it ourselves.  

We collaborate closely with Engineering and DevOps teams, sharing ownership of outcomes through fast feedback loops and collective wins, no ticket tossing. Continuous learning is part of our DNA: we conduct open post\\-mortems, test ideas through small\\-scale experiments, and continually refine our approach. Our engineers have the freedom to choose the right tools for the job and are encouraged to think creatively to solve complex problems. It’s a space for builders who enjoy autonomy, collaboration, and impact at scale. **About GoTo Group**

**Program Background**
The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia's large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program's core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia's previous 19 years of support to Indonesia's decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:* Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub\\-national service delivery.
* Pillar 2: Better sub\\-national governance for service delivery.
* Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.

  

SKALA is implemented at the national level with an office in Jakarta and at the subnational level with offices in Aceh, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku, Gorontalo, Kalimantan Utara, Tanah Papua. In addition to the 3 pillars, SKALA works across 4 general themes of Public Financial Management, Minimum Service Standards, Data and Analysis and GEDSI. **About DT Global Asia Pacific**
At DT Global Asia Pacific, we aim to positively impact people’s lives through delivery excellence. As a leading implementing partner across Asia and the Pacific, we co\\-create locally led solutions in partnership with governments, communities, and stakeholders.

**Program Background**
The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia's large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program's core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia's previous 19 years of support to Indonesia's decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:* Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub\\-national service delivery.

--------------------


Zeroe is where sustainability starts.


We build the data infrastructure every ESG report, decarbonization plan, and climate finance decision depends on.


Zeroe connects business operations to auditable, multi\\-metric outcomes across carbon, energy, water, waste, and finance. Built for the realities of emerging markets and complex enterprise systems, Zeroe operationalizes the full sustainability data lifecycle—from collection and transformation to validation and reporting—across entities, suppliers, and business units.


Where most ESG tools start at the report, Zeroe starts at the data. Our platform integrates directly with ERPs, procurement systems, and finance structures to turn fragmented information into a single, verifiable source of truth. Reporting then becomes the natural output once the inputs are trustworthy.


For enterprises, Zeroe turns sustainability from a reporting obligation into a performance system\\-linking operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and access to finance.


Headquartered in Dubai and operating across the GCC and Southeast Asia, Zeroe is building the world’s sustainability data infrastructure from the Middle East \\- proving that world\\-class technology can emerge from the region.

**Program Background**
The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia's large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program's core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia's previous 19 years of support to Indonesia's decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:* Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub\\-national service delivery.
* Pillar 2: Better sub\\-national governance for service delivery.
* Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.

  

SKALA is implemented at the national level with an office in Jakarta and at the subnational level with offices in Aceh, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku, Gorontalo, Kalimantan Utara, Tanah Papua.

* Managing the sales cycle end\\-to\\-end, ensuring high\\-quality outcomes.
* Building relationships with internal teams (account, generalist/specialist sales, Cyber product, customer success teams) and external (clients, strategic partners)
* Collaborating with Product and Marketing teams to develop a unified MA Cyber narrative and sales process

  

Success will be measured by sales performance, client impact, and contribution to the expansion of Mastercard’s cybersecurity solutions footprint.  

  

Required Qualifications

General experience  

* Experience in complex organization structures, managing and building effective relationships with internal and external stakeholders.
* Demonstrated ability to build trust\\-based relationships with both mid\\- and executive\\-level clients

---------------

* **5\\+ years of end\\-to\\-end product design experience**, ideally in dating or social platforms, chat\\-based experiences, AI\\-generation tools, or live‑interactive gamified products
* Strong skills in interaction design, visual design, responsive design and information architecture
* Proven ability to ship impactful features from 0 1 and iterate based on real\\-world feedback
* Proficiency in Figma, with the ability to create production\\-ready UI assets
* Expert\\-level prototyping skills to clearly communicate ideas, flows, and interactions to developers and stakeholders
* Resourceful problem\\-solving: able to find creative solutions that achieve both beauty and practicality.

The project is currently in **prototype stage**, built on **Bubble.io**, with **UI/UX completed** and ready for expansion.

**The Role**

We’re looking for a **creative, disciplined, and entrepreneurial Bubble Developer** who wants to **take ownership** of this project’s technical direction and long\\-term growth.

This is not just a “build what you’re told” position.

We’re looking for someone who thinks **strategically**, plans ahead, and can **lead the product** as it evolves — both technically and operationally.

You’ll begin by helping us **finalize the MVP**, and as the project develops, **transition into a leadership role** overseeing a small team (designers, marketing, and support).

**The Two Phases**

**Phase 1 – MVP Finalization (Immediate Start):**

* Review and continue building the current **Bubble** prototype (core functionality: classes, bookings, QR offer validation, partner dashboards).

* Strong understanding of **no\\-code logic**, **API integration**, and **responsive design**.
* A **problem solver** — able to identify better solutions, not just follow instructions.
* **Organized and forward\\-thinking** — able to plan and structure tasks efficiently.
* **Creative and proactive** — comfortable contributing ideas on design, UX, or growth.
* Interested in the **fitness, wellness, and lifestyle** sector (a big plus).

**Bonus Skills**

* Basic design understanding (Figma / Stitch / Canva).
* Project management or leadership experience.
* Familiarity with marketing tools, analytics, or community building.

**Location \\& Collaboration**

* Must be physically **based in Bali**.
* Regular in\\-person meetings (typically weekly) near **Seseh / Canggu area**.
* Remote work in between meetings is fine — strong communication is key.

**How to Apply**

Please include:

* A short intro about yourself and what excites you about this project.
* Links to **previous Bubble projects** or your portfolio.
* Expected **monthly or project\\-based compensation**.
* Current location and availability.

**Why Join Us**

### **How to become a Junior QA Specialist at scandiweb eCommerce expert team?**

  

We are a very inclusive company with colleagues across 30\\+ countries on all continents with the female developer ratio being among the highest in the industry. We welcome people from different paths of life, who can complete a technical test, which consists of a testing challenge.  

  

The test does not require you to have previous QA experience, instead, it focuses on aspects like checking your attention to detail and ability to use common sense and bringing structure to a complex environment. You have the opportunity to look holistically at a project and to perform various actions that are reflective of actual QA work in Scandiweb. We also test your capability to learn during the test as we will share educational materials for some of the tasks.  

Everybody who completes the Entry Level test and successfully passes the Practical Trial day task, is invited to an interview. We are confident that if you can complete the entry\\-level test and successfully pass the Practical Trial Day task, you have the necessary background to let us guide you further on the path to engineering expertise and enterprise\\-level delivery.  

Your previous experience and education do not matter; what matters is your ability to deliver results starting from the test task, and your enthusiasm and openness to embrace new knowledge and processes. You can even fail the test and redo it; we will provide you with feedback and will appreciate your ability to act on it to improve and pass. Continuous learning and acting on feedback are among our core organizational values.### **What are the responsibilities of a Junior QA Specialist?**

  

Once you start your career at scandiweb, your first responsibility is to complete onboarding in the company, setting you up in all the processes and systems. This process is set forth in our Learning System and you will be supported by an HR member of our team.  

Your next responsibility is to complete the Starter Training Course to ensure that you can join a commercial project with a minimum necessary knowledge of the workflow and quality requirements.
  

Once you start your active work in the role of Junior QA Specialist, your responsibilities will include:* Revising your active pipeline of the tasks, discussing them at Daily Standup making sure tasks are clear for you and nothing blocks you from delivering;
* Participating in Daily Standups with the team is crucial for understanding the project's direction, its current status, the completion of tasks, and ensuring there are no pending bugs as we enter the UAT period;
* Understanding the tasks, functional, and business scope not only ensures that the project is pixel\\-perfect and all required features are functioning correctly but also ensure that the tasks work together with the solution components;
* Creating test cases before starting work allows the developer assigned to the task to have a better chance of success by following your test cases. This ensures that the necessary functionality and integration for the feature are covered within the project;
* Identifying issues and errors on a project and reporting them following internal company quality guidelines;
* Performing manual quality assurance using tools, like, Browserstack, DevTools, TestLodge, Lightshot, Loom, and others;

* Applying company quality standards and practices to ensure optimum project quality and delivery;

At scandiweb, we are committed to developing well\\-rounded professionals. You’ll have the chance to grow beyond your initial role by gaining cross\\-disciplinary expertise to stay on top of industry trends and excel in the future as an eCommerce expert.  

**Further career growth for Junior QA Specialist**  

You will get support in career counseling from our HR department as each career path is unique taking into account your personal strengths and ambitions.  

A successful Junior QA usually becomes an independent QA, further advancing to either a Senior manual QA or a Junior Project manager by mastering the technological, communication, and business context of their work.  

Further steps from an independent QA role will depend on your preferences for growth and impact on the company. Later on, you can become either a QA lead in and take ownership of the quality assurance processes in scandiweb or pursue the exciting role of Project Management.
  

  

Project Manager roles ultimately culminate in Delivery Manager and Partner positions, where you take strategic ownership over the delivery of multiple projects in your portfolio by guiding responsible Project Managers and teams ensuring good project vitals, focusing on expanding cooperation and building relations with existing and new clients.  

  

**What will help you to advance in your career starting as Junior QA Specialist?**
* Deepening your knowledge of libraries, frameworks, and platforms that are necessary for a successful delivery for customers;
* Understanding your success KPIs that we will share with you and setting the goals to improve them;
